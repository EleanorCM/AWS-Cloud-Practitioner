# Reading the AWS Cloud Practitioner notes
There are my notes in preparation for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam. The markdown notes are best viewed in the **Obsidian** notetaking app so that diagrams display properly.

Feel free to clone the repo to view and edit the markdown in Obsidian or your favourite editor :)
