# Reading the AWS Cloud Practitioner notes
There are my notes in preparation for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam. I created them in the **Obsidian** notetaking app using the **Timeline** community plugin to simulate the Cornell style of notetaking. 

In each topic folder, there are Markdown and PDF subfolders containing the notes in the desired format. To display markdown files correctly, they have to be viewed in Obsidian with the Timeline plugin. Alternatively, download and view the PDF files which have the formatting embedded.

Download Obsidian: https://obsidian.md/download

To find the Timeline plugin, open Obsidian and go to **Preferences > Community Plugins > Browse > Search 'Timeline'**
