# Reading the AWS Cloud Practitioner notes
There are my notes in preparation for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam. I created them in the **Obsidian** notetaking app using the **Timeline** community plugin to simulate the Cornell style of notetaking. 

In each topic folder, there are Markdown and PDF subfolders containing the notes in each format.

## PDF
Open the PDF folder to view or download the files

## Markdown
Clone the repository to your local machine and open the folder in Obsidian with the Timeline plugin (both must be installed for the notes to display properly)

## Download Links
- **Obsidian:** https://obsidian.md/download
- **Timeline plugin:** With Obsidian open, go to **Preferences > Community Plugins > Browse > Search 'Timeline'**
- **Timeline plugin repository:** https://github.com/George-debug/obsidian-timeline
