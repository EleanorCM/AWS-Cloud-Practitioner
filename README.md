# Reading the AWS Cloud Practitioner notes
There are my notes in preparation for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam, created in the Obsidian notetaking app. In each topic folder, there are Markdown and PDF subfolders containing the notes in the respective format. 

You can also clone the repo to view and edit the markdown in Obsidian or another editor :)
