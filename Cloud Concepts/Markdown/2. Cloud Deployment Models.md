## Public Cloud
A vendor supplies on-demand shared resources.
- Consumer cannot see or access exact physical location, but **can specify geographic regions** to use
- Vendor provides backend and **maintenance** (power, cooling, failure recovery)
- Can be accessed from any internet connection

## Private Cloud
Cloud infrastructure is privately owned, hosted and managed by the company using it.
- Gives more control of data which may be necessary to comply with security regulations
- The hardware is usually on-premise, but cloud principles (such as virtualization) are still used
- More capital expenditure and higher operating costs

## Hybrid Cloud
A combination of Public and Private Cloud models
- Usually a short-term or transitional measure (e.g. testing and development or while moving to Public Cloud)
