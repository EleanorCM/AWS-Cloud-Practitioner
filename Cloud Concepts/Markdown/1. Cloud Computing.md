The **Cloud** is a **remote pool of on-demand, shared resources** including Compute, Storage, Database and Networking (sometimes also Machine Learning and AI resources). These resources can be **rapidly deployed at scale**.

## Virtualisation
Used in on-premise data centres for a long time. It means that ==multiple **virtual machines** share the same physical hardware== and resources.


### Hypervisor
![[Cloud Concepts/Virtualisation.svg]]

Software that enables the sharing of physical resources between virutal machines and handles access

### Benefits of Virtualization
- Reduced capital expenditure and running costs
- Smaller carbon footprint
- Optimizes resources

## Cloud Resources

### Compute
The "Brains" to process the workload

### Storage
For saving and storing data. Consists of:
- Server harddisks (local storage)
- Network attached storage (NAS)
- High-speed Storage Area Network (SAN)

### Database
Persist structured sets of data used by your app

### Network
Connects all other resources together. Includes:
- Routers to route traffic
- Firewalls to allow or deny traffic


## Summary
The Cloud is a **remote pool of on-demand shared resources**. Resources used can be scaled up or down without the need for organizations to buy physical servers and resources. This also eliminates the cost of cooling and maintaining them.
