EC2 allows you to deploy virtual servers (called "**instances**") in the AWS environment.

## Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
![[AMIs in Marketplace.png]]

AMIs are **EC2 Instance templates**, intended for quickly launching EC2 instances. They consist of an image baseline with an Operating System, applications and configuration settings.

You can create your own AMIs or find them in the AWS Marketplace and from the community.

## Instance Types
The Instance Type defintes the size of the instance - similar to choosing a computer based on its specifications. You can select the most appropriate for your needs.

There are also instance families, which are groups of types for special purposes.

## Instance Purchasing Options

### On-Demand Instances
On-Demand Instances can be launched **at any time for as long as needed**. There is a flat rate charged, per second, based on the instance type. Typically these are short-term and are often used for Testing and Development.

### Reserved Instances
These last for a **set period of time at a reduced cost**. Usually 1- or 3-year timeframes. Payment options:
- **Upfront**, for the greatest discount as compared to On-Demand Instances
- **Partial Upfront**, some now, the rest later
- **No Upfront**, pay later and receive the smallest discount
These are good for long-term predictable workloads.

### Scheduled Instances
Pay for reservations on a schedule (daily, weekly or monthly). You are charged whether you use it or not.

### Spot Instances
These are **unused EC2 Compute resources that you bid for**. There is no guarantee that you will have the resources for any fixed period of time, as the price fluctuates based on supply and demand.

With Spot Instances, you can get large EC2 instances at very low prices. They are useful for background jobs and data processing - anything that **can be interrupted** without causing you problems.

### On-Demand Capacity Reservations
You can reserve capacity based on your given requirements within an Availability Zone for any period of time. This can be used with your reserved instanced discount.

### Tenancy
This refers to the physical server. There are different types of tenancy:

| Tenancy Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shared Tenancy     | Your instance is on any available hardware, and may be beside multiple other tenants.                                                                                           |
| Dedicated Instance | You are on hardware with no other tenants. This incurs additional charged. May be required to comply with certain policies                                                      |
| Dedicated Hosts    | You as a customer have more visibility and control on the host. Multiple of **your** instances may be on the same host. Again, may be necessary to meet compliance requirements |

## User Data
Commands you can enter to run in the first boot cycle of the instance. This may include pulling software from a repo, OS updates, etc).
