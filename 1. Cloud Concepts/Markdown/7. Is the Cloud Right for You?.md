An organization should first ask:
- Where is the business going?
- What are they trying to acheive?
- What are their business objectives?
- Where do they lack in development (strategic/financial/customer experience)?
- What are the key challenges the business faces?

Once they have these answers, they should ask, **"can we acheive these goals via Cloud computing?"**

- Innovation potential
- Swift go-to-market
- Carbon footprint reduction
- Remote access, with the possibility of sourcing staff worldwide
