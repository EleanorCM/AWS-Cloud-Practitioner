## Migration of production services
Organization moving from on-premise to Cloud might adopt Hybrid model

## Traffic Bursting
For example at Christmas, when a business knows they will have a spike in traffic. With the Cloud, they don't have to buy additional hardware or pay to run, cool or maintain it, only to terminate it after a short time.

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

Cloud services have Data Management Lifecycle Policies. For example, with Amazon S3 you can archive data older than 30 days to AWS Glacier for low-cost long-term storage

Benefits include:
- Load-balancing across multiple instances
- Automated scaling (Elasticity)
- Access to: 
  - Content Delivery Network (CDN), which reduces latency by redirecting traffic to the closest caching server
  - Domain Name System (DNS), which directs incoming requests to a load balancer to be evenly distrubuted to multiple servers

## Test and Development Environments
The ability to create temporary instances on-demand with no impact on existing production versions lends itself to testing and experimentation

## Proof of Concept
Excellent for presenting prototypes and business cases to senior management and clients
