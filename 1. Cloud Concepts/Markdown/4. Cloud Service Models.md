## Software as a Service (SaaS)
For delivery of a widely distributable and accessible application, e.g. Gmail

Provides the least amount of customization.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Greater control and management, with access to the framework from the Operating System up. The hardware is still managed by the vendor.

This is often the best option for software developers.

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Offers the highest level of customisation and management. With IaaS you can architect your own piece of the cloud via a virtual network.

You can deploy any resources you need and configure instances from the Operating System up, including choosing the **type** of OS.

## Other Service Models

- Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS)
- Communications as a Service (CaaS)
- Monitoring as a Service (MaaS)
